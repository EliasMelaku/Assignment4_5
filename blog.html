            <article>
                <p>
                    The Question:Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem)
                     on styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Answer:
                </p>
                <p>
                    This question is one that is most often discussed and talked
                    about. And after careful consideration I have come to the conclusion
                    that the answer is YES. When styling a website it is best to use
                    these relative sizes. The effect may not show during normal viewing 
                    time, but when the browser is resized or the zoom feature is used
                    relative sizings are leaps beyond the fixed one. This is true for 
                    most cases and there is a small amount of elements that could benefit
                    from fixed sizes (like a navigation bar maybe) but overall, it is best
                    to use relative ones.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A major advantage is that it prevents overlapping of elements during zooming. If for example
                    an element is given a fixed size in <em>px</em> and there are multiple items in the
                    same row, after a certain point the two (or more) elements are bound to overlap.
                    If the given size is in "%" however (rem/em as well) the elements adjust their size 
                    and will have an overall similar layout, regardless of the zoom amount.

        <section>
            <p class="Title">The Second Question</p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The Question:We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? 
                    How does the browser interpret that ? 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Answer:
                </p>
                <p>
                    When starting to design an HTML website, unless otherwise set,
                    the default font size given to all elements is the root size which is 16px, which also becomes the 
                    default browser width, because every element inherits from the root.

                </p>
                <p>
                    So it might come as a surprise if we try to set the width to 200px, which is much larger
                    than the specified default. How the browser interprets this can be explained with percentage. 
                    If 16px is not enough for us (which it isn't in most cases) we need to go bigger, so when we set the 
                    width to 160px for example the browser interprets this as 1000% of the default, or as we can see, ten times
                    that of the default set by the browser in the root.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This doesn't mean the size of the actual browser/screen is 16px, it just means that
                    the browser gives 16px as a default to our website initially, then we can adjust 
                    that by overriding it.
                </p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    The Question: What are the specific changes in CSS3?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Answer:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                   CSS or Cascading Style Sheets are used to give style to
                   the HTML we have written. And like any other software
                   or computer language, it has evolved and will keep evolving
                   with time. We are currently using CSS3 and it has shown some
                   some major changes from the last iteration of CSS,some of which are listed
                   below.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <h4>Added atrribute selectors</h4> 
                        <p>CSS2 already had quite a lot attribute selectors
                            and CSS3 expanded on that. It introduced three attribute selectors.
                            <ul>
                                <li>E[attr^=val]</li>
                                <li>E[attr$=val]</li>
                                <li>E[attr*=val]</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All three are related to selecting an attribute (attr) that matches
                            the given value (val). The first one matches attributes that begin with 
                            val, the second that end with it, and the third mathces attributes
                            which have val anywhere within them.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Pseudo Classes</h4>
                        <p>A few more pseudo-class selectors were added in CSS3. One is the :root selector,
                             which allows designers to point to the root element of a document. In HTML, 
                             it would be <html>. Since :root is generic, it allows a designer to select the root 
                            element of an XML document without necessarily knowing it’s name. To permit scrollbars
                             when needed in a document, this rule would work.</p>
                             <p>
                                As a complement to the :first-child selector, the :last-child was added.
                                 With it one can select the last element named of a parent element.
                                 It can be used to style the last element differently.
                             </p>
                             A new user interaction pseudo-class selector was added, the :target selector. To draw the user’s attention to a span of text when the user clicks on a same-page link.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Colors</h4>
                        <p>
                            CSS3 brings with it support for some new ways of describing colours . Prior to CSS3, we almost always declared colours using the hexadecimal format (#FFF, or #FFFFFF for white). It was also possible to declare colours using the rgb() notation, providing either integers (0–255) or percentages.
                            The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional keyword colors (that are generally well supported), CSS3 also provides us with a number of other options: HSL, HSLA, and RGBA. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare semitransparent colors.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Border Radius</h4>
                        <p>
                            The border-radius property lets you create rounded corners without the need for images or additional markup. 
                            The border-radius property is actually a shorthand. For our “a” element, the corners are all the same size and symmetrical. If we had wanted different-sized corners, we could declare up to four unique values
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Drop Shadow and Text Shadow</h4>
                        <p>CSS3 provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property. This property lets you specify the color, height, width, blur, and offset of one or multiple inner and/or outer drop shadows on your elements.</p>
                        <p>Text-shadow adds shadows to individual characters in text nodes. Prior to CSS 3, this would be done by either using an image or duplicating a text element and then positioning it  which would have been tiresome</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Linear Gradients</h4>
                        <p>W3C added the syntax for generating linear gradients with CSS3.The option to specify direction in degrees is also put.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Multiple Background images</h4>
                        <p>Another great thing added, in CSS3 there’s no need to include an element for multiple background images; it provides us with the ability to add more than one background image to any element, even to pseudo-elements.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>These are only the major changes that were implemented. There are lots of other ones that have not been implemented 
                    and others with less significance, but to cover them all would be impossible.
