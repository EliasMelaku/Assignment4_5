                    The Question:Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem)
                     on styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Answer:
                </p>
                <p>
                    This question is one that is most often discussed and talked
                    about. And after careful consideration I have come to the conclusion
                    that the answer is YES. When styling a website it is best to use
                    these relative sizes. The effect may not show during normal viewing 
                    time, but when the browser is resized or the zoom feature is used
                    relative sizings are leaps beyond the fixed one. This is true for 
                    most cases and there is a small amount of elements that could benefit
                    from fixed sizes (like a navigation bar maybe) but overall, it is best
                    to use relative ones.

                <p>
                    A major advantage is that it prevents overlapping of elements during zooming. If for example
                    an element is given a fixed size in <em>px</em> and there are multiple items in the
                    same row, after a certain point the two (or more) elements are bound to overlap.
                    If the given size is in "%" however (rem/em as well) the elements adjust their size 
                    and will have an overall similar layout, regardless of the zoom amount.

            <p class="Title">The Second Question</p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The Question:We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? 
                    How does the browser interpret that ? 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Answer:
                </p>
                <p>
                    When starting to design an HTML website, unless otherwise set,
                    the default font size given to all elements is the root size which is 16px, which also becomes the 
                    default browser width, because every element inherits from the root.

                </p>
                <p>
                    So it might come as a surprise if we try to set the width to 200px, which is much larger
                    than the specified default. How the browser interprets this can be explained with percentage. 
                    If 16px is not enough for us (which it isn't in most cases) we need to go bigger, so when we set the 
                    width to 160px for example the browser interprets this as 1000% of the default, or as we can see, ten times
                    that of the default set by the browser in the root.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This doesn't mean the size of the actual browser/screen is 16px, it just means that
                    the browser gives 16px as a default to our website initially, then we can adjust 
                    that by overriding it.
                </p>
