                    The Question:Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem)
                     on styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Answer:
                </p>
                <p>
                    This question is one that is most often discussed and talked
                    about. And after careful consideration I have come to the conclusion
                    that the answer is YES. When styling a website it is best to use
                    these relative sizes. The effect may not show during normal viewing 
                    time, but when the browser is resized or the zoom feature is used
                    relative sizings are leaps beyond the fixed one. This is true for 
                    most cases and there is a small amount of elements that could benefit
                    from fixed sizes (like a navigation bar maybe) but overall, it is best
                    to use relative ones.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A major advantage is that it prevents overlapping of elements during zooming. If for example
                    an element is given a fixed size in <em>px</em> and there are multiple items in the
                    same row, after a certain point the two (or more) elements are bound to overlap.
                    If the given size is in "%" however (rem/em as well) the elements adjust their size 
                    and will have an overall similar layout, regardless of the zoom amount.
